I did some troubleshooting with Vince Carpino on this assignment. 

1) What observations did you make about the estimated mean and 
variance in regards to the amount of data points generated?

As expected, the fewer data points the program had to work with,
the less accurate the estimations were for the mean and variance.
I was, however, very surprised at how accurate the 1,000,000 data
point estimation was. It was often off by only .01 - .001 or so.

2) How could have computer graphics or visualization been used to
augment these programs or assist in the data analysis?

A visualization would have helped immensely to see just how far apart
the data points actually were. Looking at calculations in the terminal
is not a good way to grasp the span of a data set. For the 10 numbers,
I would imagine they would be relatively far apart, whereas the one
million point visualization would be more like a dense cloud.
